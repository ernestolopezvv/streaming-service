# streaming-service

Final second semester project

In recent years, streaming services have proliferated, for example Netflix, Disney, DC among others. A limited version to support a future provider of this
type of service is described below:

We want to work with two types of videos: movies and series. Every video has an ID, a name, a duration and a genre (drama, action, mystery).

The series have episodes and each episode has a title and season to which it belongs.

We are interested in knowing the average rating that each of the videos has received. This rating is on a scale of 1 to 5 where 5 is the best rating.

The system must be able to :

- Read all the files 
- Show all the information in display
- Show the videos in general with their ratings
- Show the episodes of a certain series with their ratings
- Show the movies with their ratings
- Rate a video and modify the grade
- Close de program
